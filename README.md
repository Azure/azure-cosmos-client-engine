# Azure Cosmos DB Client Engine

The Azure Cosmos DB Client Engine is a native library, written in Rust, which provides support functionality for Azure Cosmos DB SDKs.
The primary feature it provides is the Query Engine, which handles fanning out cross-partition queries across individual partitions and aggregating the results.

This repo contains two main components:

* The Client Engine itself, which is a Rust project that produces both a standard Rust crate for use in the Azure SDK for Rust, as well as C-compatible shared and static libraries for use in other languages.
* Client Engine Wrappers for multiple languages. These wrappers handle the packaging and language-specific bindings for the Client Engine and export an API that the Azure Cosmos DB SDK can optionally consume to perform more complicated cross-partition queries.

## Setting up your development environment

The preferred development environment for this repository is a Linux environment, which includes Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 2.
The ideal way to configure your environment is to install the [devenv](https://devenv.sh) tool in your Linux environment.
Once you've installed this tool in your environement, you can run `devenv shell` in the root of the repository to prepare an isolated development environment with all the necessary dependencies.
Alternatively, configure your shell with devenv's [Automatic Shell Activation](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/) feature and the development environment will be automatically configured when you change directory in to the repository.

The `devenv` tool also provides instructions on how to use VS Code with your development environment: https://devenv.sh/editor-support/vscode/.
Once you set that up, Rust, Python, and Go integration should mostly Just Workâ„¢.

### Manual Setup

If you are unable to use the devenv tool, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Rust 1.80.0 or later
* Go 1.23 or later
* Python 3. Using a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is also HIGHLY recommended.

## Building

To build the client engine itself, you can run `cargo build` from the root of the repository.
However, this will only build the client engine's Rust code and will not build the C bindings, nor the `libcosmoscx` library used by other languages.
Use the `build-driver` script, which is available when you're inside the `devenv shell` environment, to build the client engine and the C bindings.
This will produce the necessary native libraries and C include files in the `artifacts` directory in the root of the repository.
It will also compile the Python native module and install it into the virtualenv created by the `devenv` tool.

### Building and testing Go

**After** running `build-driver`, you can test the Go bindings by running `go -C ./go/engine test ./...`.
If you haven't run `build-driver` yet, the Go tests will fail to compile with an error like this, indicating the `artifacts` directory isn't properly set up:

```
> go -C ./go/engine test ./...
?       github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-client-engine/go/engine   [no test files]
# github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-client-engine/go/engine/native
native/native.go:9:11: fatal error: 'cosmoscx.h' file not found
    9 |  #include <cosmoscx.h>
      |           ^~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
FAIL    github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-client-engine/go/engine/native [build failed]
FAIL
```

### Building and testing Python

> [!NOTE]
> For now, the Python module we create is named `azure_cosmoscx`.
At some point before release, we may rearrange this so that we create a module named `azure.cosmos.client_engine` instead.
However, this requires changes to the `azure.cosmos` package (to support being a namespace module), which is in the Azure SDK for Python repository.

**After** running `build-driver`, you can test the Python bindings by running `python -m pytest ./python`.
If you haven't run `build-driver` yet, the Python tests will fail to compile with an error like this, indicating the Python venv isn't properly set up:

```
ImportError while importing test module '/home/ashleyst/code/Azure/azure-cosmos-client-engine/python/test/test_engine_version.py'.
Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.
