# Query Correctness Data

This directory contains a set of query correctness data, and a .NET application to generate that data.
The data is used to test the Client Engine against a known-good query engine, the one available in the .NET SDK.

The `queries` directory contains a set of "suite" files, like `order_by.json`, which contains a set of test data (by way of referencing a JSON file in `testdata`) and a set of queries to run against that data.
Subdirectories in `queries` contain the results generated by the .NET SDK, which are used to verify the results of the engine.
The .NET application in `baseline-generator` can be used to generate and update the results.
